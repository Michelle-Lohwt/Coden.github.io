### Step 1: Fork the project

![fork](https://github.com/Michelle-Lohwt/Coden.github.io/blob/branch1/assets/pic1_fork.png)

<ul>
  <li>Add the forked repository to your computer directory:</li>
  <blockquote>

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Coden.github.io 
    
# This is a comment, change **repo_name** in the following to your repository name
$ cd repo_name 
    
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/CodenCommunity/Coden.github.io
```
  </blockquote>
</ul>
  
---

### Step 2: Find an issue
* Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!  
* Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.  
* Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue.

### Step 3: Create a branch
<ul>
  <li>Create a new branch in your computer directory. Use its name to identify the issue you are addressing.</li>
  <blockquote>
    
```
# This is a comment, change **branch_name** in the following to the name of issue you are addressing
$ git checkout -b branch_name
```
  </blockquote>
  <li>OR you can create the branch in Github as shown here:</li>
  
![branch](https://github.com/Michelle-Lohwt/Coden.github.io/blob/branch1/assets/pic3_branch.png)
  
<blockquote>
    
```
# After you create the branch here, remember to update it in your computer directory
$ git pull
$ git checkout branch_name
```
  </blockquote>
</ul>

---
  
### Step 4: Work on the issue assigned
* Work on the issue(s) assigned to you.   
* Add all the files/folders needed.  
* After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by using terminal:  
```  
# To add all new files to branch Branch_Name  
$ git add .  

# To add only a few files to Branch_Name
$ git add <some files>
```
- Using GitHub

### Step 5: Commit
* You are suggested to use Conventional Commits in your commit message to ease other contributors reading the documentation, read [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
* To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by using terminal:  
```
# This message get associated with all files you have changed  
$ git commit -m "message"  
```
- Using GitHub
![commit](https://github.com/Michelle-Lohwt/Coden.github.io/blob/branch1/assets/pic5_commit.png)
---
  
### Step 6: Push it to your forked branch
* Push your changes to the forked branch
```
git push
```
* You should see something like this in your Github after pushing:
![push](https://github.com/Michelle-Lohwt/Coden.github.io/blob/branch1/assets/pic6_push.png)
---
  
### Step 7: Make a Pull Request (PR)
* Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests. Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.
![pull_request](https://github.com/Michelle-Lohwt/Coden.github.io/blob/branch1/assets/pic7_create_pull.png)
* AND compare the forked branch with the main branch
![compare](https://github.com/Michelle-Lohwt/Coden.github.io/blob/branch1/assets/pic8_compare_repo.png)
