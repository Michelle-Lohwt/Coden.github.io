  <blockquote>
    
```
# This is a comment, change **branch_name** in the following to the name of issue you are addressing
$ git checkout -b branch_name
```
  </blockquote>
  <li>OR you can create the branch in Github as shown here:</li>
  
![branch](https://github.com/Michelle-Lohwt/Coden.github.io/blob/branch1/assets/pic3_branch.png)
  
<blockquote>
    
```
# After you create the branch here, remember to update it in your computer directory
$ git pull
$ git checkout branch_name
```
  </blockquote>
</ul>

---
  
### Step 4: Work on the issue assigned
* Work on the issue(s) assigned to you.   
* Add all the files/folders needed.  
* After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by using terminal:  
```  
# To add all new files to branch Branch_Name  
$ git add .  

# To add only a few files to Branch_Name
$ git add <some files>
```

### Step 5: Commit

```
# This message get associated with all files you have changed  
$ git commit -m "message"  
```

### Step 6: Push it to your forked branch
* Push your changes to the forked branch
```
git push
```
* You should see something like this in your Github after pushing:
![push](https://github.com/Michelle-Lohwt/Coden.github.io/blob/branch1/assets/pic6_push.png)
---
  
### Step 7: Make a Pull Request (PR)
* Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests. Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.
![pull_request](https://github.com/Michelle-Lohwt/Coden.github.io/blob/branch1/assets/pic7_create_pull.png)
* AND compare the forked branch with the main branch
![compare](https://github.com/Michelle-Lohwt/Coden.github.io/blob/branch1/assets/pic8_compare_repo.png)
